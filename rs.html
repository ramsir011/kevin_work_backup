    <li>I am the property owner or representative agent of the delivery address listed.</li>
    <li>I will hold the tree service company delivering wood chips harmless for any damage (including, but not limited to, driveway cracks, underground utility damage, and turf damage) resulting from the use of their vehicles and equipment in delivering the wood chips.</li>
    <li>I understand that the tree service company can deliver no less than a full truckload of wood chips, that the quantity of wood chips per truckload is variable, and there may be more or fewer wood chips than I need for my project. I will not complain about the amount of wood chips delivered unless more than the specified number of truckloads of wood chips are delivered.</li>
    <li>I understand that efforts will be taken to keep the wood chip load will be free of logs and other trash but that the quality of wood chips is variable.</li>
    <li>I understand that chips are delivered as convenient for the particular tree service company making the delivery, not on a first-come-first-served basis. I understand that delivery is not guaranteed.</li>
    <li>I will accept delivery of the chips on any reasonable part of my property if my preferred dump location is unreachable.</li>
    <li>I understand that poisonous plants (including, but not limited to, poison oak and poison ivy) are occasionally included in the wood chip load and agree to hold the company delivering the chips harmless for any discomfort, illness or malady resulting from the presence of any poisonous plants in the wood chips.</li>
    <li>The designated dump area MUST be flat, and have no overhead utilities.</li>
    <li>I do not expect a call before the chips are delivered and I authorize delivery of the chips within the specified time period that I chose unless I add that I need a phone call in the notes section.</li>
